# My blog
Just a collection of blog posts I share online (and maybe some that maybe I don't  ¯\_(ツ)_/¯). 

# Why?
When writing posts I thought about it wouldn't a version control make sense? And and after seeing [npamaile's blog](https://github.com/npmaile/blog) I have decided to do the same. 

# Where
My posts tend to be written in markdown and hosted on [dev.to](https://dev.to/jdvert).
